# python-learning-journal
A repository to document my learnings in my WVC python class.

#About Me
My name is Dristi Roy and I'm a Junior at Branham High School. I like to code, practice kung fu, and play the piano. I also like to build robots, play the flute, draw and sing. My most recent objective with coding is to attend more hackathons, classes and work on my personal projects more.

#Goals for This Course
I really enjoy coding, and I look forward to future Python projects. I'm excited to learn more about how data structures are specifically implemented in Python as well as grow even more fluent in the language, though not the main objective of this course. DSA practice is always good. I am also glad to hear that this course also potentially incorporates my area of interest in AI.
