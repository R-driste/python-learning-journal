Hello! Here are some points I took away from the first week of Python lectures.
We spent the first day primarily reviewing the class expectations. Mr. Calle discussed that we should enter the class with good Python familiarity and can expect to practice implementing common data structures and algorithms in Python such as maps, trees, searching, and sorting. Later in the week, we recapped the concept of encapsulation and abstraction (hiding data away in bigger objects with simpler functionality) during our Pokemon lab. We went over the difference between public/private data and how methods retrieve object data in Python. We ran through a list of common abstract data types (which have a high-level set of operations) by how their nodes are organized.   Finally, in today's lecture, we primarily retouched recursion, which is the implementation of self-calling functions that operate till the base case is met and their position in the call stack is reversed. Studying data structures and algorithms is relevant to optimizing people's ability to solve complex problems, and many issues remain unsolved to today.
